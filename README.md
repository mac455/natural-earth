## Natural Earth 

This repository contains the code and analysis for the Natural Earth dataset. 
The project uses geospatial data to visualise and analyse population, and  global economic metrics like Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and GDP per capita through choropleth maps.

## Project Overview
This project uses the Natural Earth dataset to analyse global GDP and GDP per capita using choropleth maps. The analysis provides insights into:

- Population estimates
- GDP across different regions: Highlighting countries with the largest economies by GDP.
- GDP per capita distribution: Offering a deeper look at how wealth is distributed per person, providing a more nuanced understanding of economic health than raw GDP figures.
- Visual comparison: A critical comparison between GDP and GDP per capita, illustrating how population size can affect economic rankings and living standards.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis comes from the Natural Earth project. It includes shapefiles for country boundaries, as well as economic data such as GDP and population.

## Installation
To run the code in this repository, you'll need to have the following tools installed:

Jupyter Notebook
Python 3.x

## Analysis 
- Geospatial Visualisation: Choropleth maps are created to visually represent the GDP and GDP per capita of various countries worldwide.
- GDP Analysis: A map-based view of GDP shows the economic powerhouses like China, the US, and European countries.
- GDP per Capita Analysis: The GDP per capita map illustrates how wealth is distributed on a per-person basis, revealing that smaller countries with high GDP per capita, such as in Europe and Oceania, often outperform larger economies in terms of individual wealth.
